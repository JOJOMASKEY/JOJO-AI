    "query": "how do i grow basil indoors?",
    "response": "1. Choose the right location: Basil loves warm temperatures and lots of sunlight. Choose a south-facing window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight each day. \n\n2. Select a pot: Choose a pot that's at least 6 to 8 inches deep. The pot also needs to have good drainage holes.\n\n3. Use high-quality soil: Basil loves well-draining soil that's rich in organic matter. Using potting mix specifically designed for herbs can provide this.\n\n4. Plant the seeds: Plant the basil seeds just about 1/4 inch deep. Space them about 10 to 12 inches apart.\n\n5. Watering: Water the seeds lightly. Basil does not like to sit in overly watered soil. \n\n6. After seeds germinate, thin to one plant per pot. \n\n7. Regular Pruning: Once the plant reaches about 6 inches in height, start pruning. This will encourage the plant to grow bushier.\n\n8. Fertilizer: Feed your plants every couple of weeks with a liquid fertilizer. \n\n9. Keep away from drafts and fluctuating temperatures. \n\n10. Repotting: If your basil plant outgrows its pot, move it to a larger one. \n\nRemember to harvest often to encourage growth throughout the summer. Enjoy your fresh basil! \n\nNote: Indoor-grown basil may not be as aromatic or flavorful as outdoor-grown basil.",

    "query": "how do i grow basil indoors?",
    "response": "1. Choose a variety: Select a basil type that suits your culinary needs. Sweet basil is popular for cooking, while spicy globe basil is wonderful for salads.\n\n2. Start from seeds: Plant the seeds in a seed tray or directly into pots. Seeds should be planted about 1/4-inch deep and seedlings should show in about two weeks.\n\n3. Give them Light: Basil loves lots of light, ideally 6-8 hours a day. A window sill that receives plenty of sun or a grow-light can be used in the absence of natural light.\n\n4. Soil and Water: Basil needs well-draining soil to avoid waterlog. Water the basil when the top of the soil is dry to the touch. \n\n5. Temperature: Basil does well in temperatures of about 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit (15-24 degrees Celsius).\n\n6. Regular Pruning: For a bushier plant and to prevent blooming, prune regularly. Pinch off the center shoot after about six weeks to prevent early seeding. \n\n7. Pest Management: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids. If they appear, use a gentle insecticidal soap to keep them at bay.\n\nRemember, if a basil plant flowers, the strength of its leaves' flavor will lessen so it's best to keep removing the flowers and the tops of the stems to encourage new leaf growth.",

During this crisis session, it was identified that Mr. Maskey is experiencing a mental \nhealth condition that significantly impacts his ability to participate in a full time academic course load. Mr. Maskey meets the minimum criteria for an adjustment \ndisorder with mixed anxiety and depression. Further assessment is required to determine the existence of an additional diagnosis of post traumatic stress \ndisorder. Due to this finding,  writer is recommending a Reduced Course Load of 9 credits lasting until the end of Spring  2025 semester, ending May 18, 2025.  \nMr. Maskey will complete for a full intake assessment at SHAW on 4/8/2025, at 12:00pm, and it is expected that he will participate in treatment through the end \nof the semester. I am optimistic that with proper support and intervention, he will gain better symptom control. With ongoing treatment Mr. Maskey's prognosis is \ngood. Mr. Maskey seems motivated and passionate by his academic pursuits, and it is anticipated that this motivation will help him to perform at the satisfactory \nlevel in the future. \nI advocate on his behalf that he be able to remain in classes this semester with a reduced course load up to 9 credits, with the expectation that he continues to \nfollow the recommended treatment plan. Please extend all possible courtesies.\nSincerely,\nConstance Phillips\nSHAW Counselor \nMSW, LCSW, CSAC, ICS\nMH License# 8829 - 123\nContact: \nPhone: (414)257-8358\nEmail: philli65@uwm.edu\n\u00a0\n\n",
