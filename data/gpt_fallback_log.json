    "query": "how do i grow basil indoors?",
    "response": "1. Choose the right location: Basil loves warm temperatures and lots of sunlight. Choose a south-facing window that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight each day. \n\n2. Select a pot: Choose a pot that's at least 6 to 8 inches deep. The pot also needs to have good drainage holes.\n\n3. Use high-quality soil: Basil loves well-draining soil that's rich in organic matter. Using potting mix specifically designed for herbs can provide this.\n\n4. Plant the seeds: Plant the basil seeds just about 1/4 inch deep. Space them about 10 to 12 inches apart.\n\n5. Watering: Water the seeds lightly. Basil does not like to sit in overly watered soil. \n\n6. After seeds germinate, thin to one plant per pot. \n\n7. Regular Pruning: Once the plant reaches about 6 inches in height, start pruning. This will encourage the plant to grow bushier.\n\n8. Fertilizer: Feed your plants every couple of weeks with a liquid fertilizer. \n\n9. Keep away from drafts and fluctuating temperatures. \n\n10. Repotting: If your basil plant outgrows its pot, move it to a larger one. \n\nRemember to harvest often to encourage growth throughout the summer. Enjoy your fresh basil! \n\nNote: Indoor-grown basil may not be as aromatic or flavorful as outdoor-grown basil.",

    "response": "1. Choose a variety: Select a basil type that suits your culinary needs. Sweet basil is popular for cooking, while spicy globe basil is wonderful for salads.\n\n2. Start from seeds: Plant the seeds in a seed tray or directly into pots. Seeds should be planted about 1/4-inch deep and seedlings should show in about two weeks.\n\n3. Give them Light: Basil loves lots of light, ideally 6-8 hours a day. A window sill that receives plenty of sun or a grow-light can be used in the absence of natural light.\n\n4. Soil and Water: Basil needs well-draining soil to avoid waterlog. Water the basil when the top of the soil is dry to the touch. \n\n5. Temperature: Basil does well in temperatures of about 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit (15-24 degrees Celsius).\n\n6. Regular Pruning: For a bushier plant and to prevent blooming, prune regularly. Pinch off the center shoot after about six weeks to prevent early seeding. \n\n7. Pest Management: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids. If they appear, use a gentle insecticidal soap to keep them at bay.\n\nRemember, if a basil plant flowers, the strength of its leaves' flavor will lessen so it's best to keep removing the flowers and the tops of the stems to encourage new leaf growth.",
